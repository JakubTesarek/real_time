					It would be very desirable that all divisions, for example of the livre, the sou, the toise, the
					day, the hour, etc. would be from tens into tens. This division would result in much easier and more
					convenient calculations and would be very preferable to the arbitrary division of the livre into
					twenty sous, of the sou into twelve deniers, of the day into twenty-four hours, the hour into sixty
					minutes, etc.
